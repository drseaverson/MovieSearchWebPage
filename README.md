# MovieSearchWebPage
This is a webpage that can be run on local host to search movies with an API request by name<br>

List of a few improvements/ideas if I the time to complete them within the project: <br>
-Commit another API request for all language abbreviations and there corresponding names to display user friendly languages for each movie <br>
-Arrow buttons below table to let user switch pages of movies that are recieved from the Movie Database API for more user-friendly access to movies <br>
-More precise search options such as including searching by 'genre'/'language' options along with 'movie title' <br><br>
*If you have any questions or comments about the project, feel free to reach out to me and I can do my best to answer any questions you may have*<br><br>
